##Example Post

When making an appropriate api call you will get a matching response. Below are the parts of the call that you will need to include.

1. Header: You will need to include a header for most request 'including some get requests' that is of the following form.

4. If you do your route with all of those accounted for you should get an appropriate response. For example this is a category with no posts attached as it would be returned form a get request. If there were attached posts it would be populated.

```
  categoryType: 'test category',
  desc: 'test desc',
  _id: '58c870f9ad72fe4d9b69f9c1',
  postList: [],
  created: '2017-03-14T22:38:49.008Z'
```
